# Second_Fry's openbee modular fork

Bee Breeding with OpenPeripherals and modular backends.

## Overview

* Modules are loaded via `os.loadAPI()` call.
* Module is Provider class, which on Invocation should return class, which implements either IStorage or IBreeder interface.
* Currently implemented backends:
  * Storage:
    * Applied Energistics 2
  * Breeder:
    * Forestry Apiary

## Contribution

* Minimal interface documentation in `openbee.lua`. You may check existent implementations to see logic behind.

## In-game overview

* By default expects storage peripheral on south of breeder peripheral.
* By default expects Analyzer on west of storage peripheral.
* Configurable via `.openbee/config` file which is created after first run.
* You can edit defaults in openbee directly

## Setup

    pastebin run XxjND24H
